# hello_world
A start to something big, a collection of random ramblings, a river of personal inspiration.

Hello everyone. 
Here you have another fledgling, trying to find his way through today's mess of a world. 
The endgoal is to be a **wizard, preferably invisible**, but I'm still taking my baby-steps for now. (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻


# Branches and Commits:
The master branch will be copied to form a *feature* branch, which we will actually work on. Each edit will then be called 
a **commit**, each  with _commit messages_ to describe the changes made.
